Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

As required my project is about creating few HTLM pages about me,
using different codes and styling.
Structure of my page:
  1- my index is called Flore: simple instructions and style
  2- 2nd page: more about personal data, including picture and input box
  3-3rd page is about table, webpage background and testing css properties
  4- 4th page is about scss variable, inheritance
  5-5th page is created using bootstrap.
I have no knowledge about cmd in windows, nor about computer science.
  What was most difficult for me was to create a 1st file in SASS, no website does explain how to create them. I "borrowed" one that I found in GIT and transformed it totally.
  I am proud of my first intent :)
